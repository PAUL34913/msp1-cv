**Live Site:** 

https://paul34913.github.io/msp1-online-resume/

## Introduction

This is the repository for my online resume as part of milestone project 1 for my full stack web development course with Code Institute. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential employers, fellow students, tutors, or anyone else who may be interested in my information.

## User Experience Design(UX)

### Strategy

The aim of the site is to create a webspace with personal information in the form of an online resume. I also intend to use it to advertise myself for collaborations, and display my own work to pontential employers, clients or colleagues.

By creating the site, I hope to increase my network of students and peers, whilst creating opportunity for future work and collaborations. It is to be my online presence and proof of skills to anyone who may be interested.

### Scope

Features that I am looking to include on this site are:

-   Download of CV in traditional format
-   Map of locality
-   Contact form for collaboration and other requests
-   Blog page

These are the minimum features required for the initial build of the site. Other features are to be implemented as the site grows and my own skills improve.

### Structure

The index page will include sections for:

-   About me
-   My Skills
-   Personal Info
-   Work History

The following will have independant pages:

-   Portfolio
-   Blog
-   Contact Form

### Skeleton

For the UI, I have decided to use a single page for the personal information, whilst using independant pages for contact, blog, portfolio and CV download. I believe by doing this, the initial page will read as a CV and give the user the important information first, with the organisation of content based on what I believe is priority to the user. Blog, portfolio and contact forrm will have their own pages to give them a personal space for returning users. CV download will link to a traditonal styled CV in .PDF format so that the user can download and/or print if required. I have also provided social links to various platforms including my GitHub repositories.

The navbar, social links, and contact button are all fixed to the top of the viewport. Reagrdless of scrolling, they are always present for quick and easy access to the remainder of the site.

The contact form will require validation, ensuring that all fields are completed before the user is allowed to submit.

### Surface

**Colour Scheme**

![Surface Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PAUL34913/msp1-online-resume/main/assets/images/test-surface.png "Surface Image")

-   The sites theme consists of a white background, contrasted by black bars and trims. I have decided to keep the main background white for clean presentation, even though this contrast of colors is generally advised against from a design aspect. Red and blue have been added to compliment the theme with regards to links and buttons, and red has been used with other bright and bold colors in the images to pop against the background.

**Typography**

-   I have used the "True Bold" font for the hero image header, it compliments "Exo" which has been used for the rest of the site with Sans Serif as a backup. It gives the site a modern and clean feel, and helps to provide a professional looking layout.

**Imagery**

-   For the hero image I have created a large image with bright popping colors against a darker background. This makes the header really pop and grab the attention of the user. Other images used have been created and styled to fit within their sections and carry through the theme of the site.

## Known Bugs

### Social Link Alignment

-   Alignment of links slightly out when viewing on Safari mobile (iPhone7) and Firefox mobile (iphone 7), need to investigate.

**Fixed:**

Have added a top padding of 2px to push the links down slightly.

### About Me Image Not Loading

-   About me image was not loading when using Github pages. 

**Fixed:**

Relative path was not correct for the d-lg image.

### 1px White Lines

-   White 1px horizontal showing at bottom of two section footers when viewing on safari mobile

**Fixed:**

Improper use of DIV tags, fixed by removing some DIV's, removing section borders and placing the border on the main container.

### 1px White Lines

-   When viewing on my own mobile (i-Phone 7), using  both Safari and Firefox, there is a single 1px white line at the very bottom of the blog page. I cannot reproduce it on other peoples phones, and it is not present on any other device I have tested. Other people have failed to reproduce this on various devices also. The blog uses an identical footer to every other page where the issue is not present.

**Not Fixed**

### Index page section landing positions

-   Landing positions from anchor links between single page sections vary between browser so that the pages are slightly out of line if you click directly from one link to another.

**Not Fixed**
