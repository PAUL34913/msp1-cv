**Live Site:** 

https://paul34913.github.io/msp1-online-resume/

## Introduction

This is the website for my online resume as part of milestone project 1 for my full stack web development course with Code Institute. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential employers, fellow students, tutors, or anyone else who may be interested in my information.

## User Experience Design(UX)

### Strategy

The aim of the site is to create a webspace with personal information in the form of an online resume. I also intend to use it to advertise myself for collaborations, and display my own work to pontential employers, clients or colleagues.

By creating the site, I hope to increase my network of students and peers, whilst creating opportunity for future work and collaborations. It is to be my online presence and proof of skills to anyone who may be interested.

### Scope

Features that I am looking to include on this site are:

-   Download of CV in traditional format
-   Map of locality
-   Contact form for collaboration and other requests
-   Blog page

These are the minimum features required for the initial build of the site. Other features are to be implemented as the site grows and my own skills improve.

### Structure

The index page will include sections for:

-   About me
-   My Skills
-   Personal Info
-   Work History

The following will have independant pages:

-   Portfolio
-   Blog
-   Contact Form

### Skeleton

For the UI, I have decided to use a single page for the bulk of the information, whilst using independant pages for contact, blog, portfolio and CV download. I believe by doing this, the initial page will read as a CV and give the user the important information first, with the organisation of content based on what I believe is priority to the user. Blog and portfolio will have their own pages to give them a personal space for returning users. CV download will link to a traditonal styled CV in .PDF format so that the user can download and/or print if required. I have also provided social links to various platforms including my GitHub repositories.

The navbar, social links, and contact button are all fixed to the top of the viewport. Reagrdless of scrolling, they are always present for quick and easy access to the remainder of the site.

### Surface

**Colour Scheme**

-   The sites theme consists of a white background, contrasted by black bars and trims. I have decided to keep the main background white for clean presentation, even though this contrast of colors is generally advised against from a design aspect. Red and blue have been added to compliment the theme with regards to links and buttons, and red has been used with other bright and bold colors in the images to pop against the background.

**Typography**

-   I have used the "True Bold" font for the hero image header, it compliments "Exo" which has been used for the rest of the site with Sans Serif as a backup. It gives the site a modern and clean feel, and helps to provide a professional looking layout.

**Imagery**

-   For the hero image I have created a large image with bright popping colors against a darker background. This makes the header really pop and grab the attention of the user. Other images used have been created and styled to fit within their sections and carry through the theme of the site.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

**First Time Visitor Goals**

1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the individual.

- Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar at the top of the page, enabling the user to go to the page of their choice. Underneath the navbar is an eye catching hero image that clearly defines the purpose of the site.
- The main points are made immediately with the hero image.
- Also at there very top of the page, there is a call to action button along with social links.

2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

    1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. The site is presented in a structured order that prioritises how the information is displayed.
    2. The site uses a fixed navigation bar so that the user can navigate the site at any moment.
    3. The navbar makes use of a drop-down menu to avoid clutter and remove the need of a hamburger menu, this reduces the amount of clicks a user needs to make in order to navigate the site.

3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for previous experience, skills or work experience in order to understand more about the individuals strengths. I also want to locate their social media links in order to connect with them.
    1. At the top of the page in the navigation bar, the user is immediatley presented with a link to reach the my-skills and work-history sections,social links are also presented at the very top of the page using easy to see icons.
    2. The social links are also presented in the footer of the page for good measure.
    3. At the bottom of the "Contact Me" page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the individual on social media or the personal-info page, and highlights the links to them.

**Returning Visitor Goals**

1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to spend time reading blog entries.

    1. These are clearly linked in the navigation bar.
    2. The user will be directed to a page with archived blogs available to read.

2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the individual with any questions I may have.

    1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Me" Page.
    2. Here the user can fill out the form on the page, or are told that alternatively they can message the individual on social media or use a method from their personal info.
    3. The footer contains links to the individuals Instagram, Linkedin, Git Hub and Slack pages as well as the individuals email.
    4. Whichever link they click, it will open up in a new tab to ensure that the user can easily get back to the website.
    5. The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

**Frequent User Goals**

1. As a Frequent User, I want to find information about new and/or improved skills.

    1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the navbar link.
    2. For a mobile user already comfortable with the website layout, the section is a short swipe down the page.

2. As a Frequent user, I want to check for new portfolio entries to view current work.

    1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the portfolio link.

3. As a Frequent user, I want to check for new blog posts.
    1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link.
    2. Upon landing on the blog page, blogs will be displayed in chronological order, beginning with the newest post.

### Further Testing

## Known Bugs

### Social Link Alignment

-   Alignment of links is slightly out when viewing on Safari mobile (iPhone7) and Firefox mobile (iphone 7), need to investigate.

Fixed:

Have added a top padding of 2px to push the links down slightly.

### Firefox Mobile Night Mode

-   Night mode on Firefox mobile (iphone 7) is causing the hero image to scroll on top of the navbars instead of behind, will investigate z-index and position of bars. As the navbar colors have now flipped there is also a 1px white border between the navbar and hero image, need to investigate padding.

Fixed:

Set Navbar z-index to 1, night viewing and normal viewing both ok.

### About Me Image Not Loading

-   About me image was not loading when using Github pages. Had to start path with msp-online-resume/ instead of assets/ however, when applying this to the hero image, the hero image would then not load at all. Kept hero image as assets/ and used msp1-online-resume/ for the section images.

Fixed:

Relative path was not correct for the d-lg image.

### 1px White Lines

-   White 1px horizontal showing at bottom of two section footers when viewing on safari mobile

Fixed:

I was using a 1px border on individual sections causing a double border which seemed to be at fault, fixed by removing section borders and placing on the main container.

### Sticky Dropdown Navbar

-   When pressing the dropdown menu in safari mobile (iphone-7), and choosing a section, the drop down menu does not collapse easily after reaching the section and clicking off it.

No fix
