This is the website for my online resume as part of milestone project 1 for my full stack web development course with Code Institute. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential employers, fellow students, tutors, or anyone else who may be interested in my information.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The sites theme consists of a white background, contrasted by black bars and trims, with the sections alternating between black and white. Red and blue have been added to compliment the theme with regards to links and buttons, and red has been used with other bright and bold colors in the images to pop against the background.
    -   #### Typography
        -   I have used the "True Bold" font for the hero image header, it compliments "Exo" which has been used for the rest of the site with Sans Serif as a backup. It gives the site a modern and clean feel, and helps to provide a professional looking layout.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   For the hero image I have created a large image with bright popping colors against a darker background and used thick edges to highlight the image and accompanying hero text header. This makes the header really pop and grab the attention of the user. Other images used have been created and styled to fit within their sections and carry through the theme of the site.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the individual.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar at the top of the page, enabling the user to go to the page of their choice. Underneath the navbar is an eye catching hero image that clearly defines the purpose of the site.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image.
        3. Also at there very top of the page, there is a call to action button along with social links.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. The site is presented in a structured order that prioritises how the information is displayed.
        2. The site uses a fixed navigation bar so that the user can navigate the site at any moment with a single click.
        3. The navbar reduces to "essential" links for the mobile version, I chose not to use a hamburger menu as this would mean an extra click would be required to reach the destination, every time.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for references or testimonials to understand more about the individuals strengths. I also want to locate their social media links in order to connect with them.
        1. At the top of the page in the navigation bar, the user is immediatley presented with a link to reach the testimonials section,social links are also presented at the very top of the page using easy to see icons.
        2. The social links are also presented in the footer of the page for good measure.
        3. At the bottom of the "Contact Me" page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the individual on social media and highlights the links to them.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to spend time reading blog entries.

        1. These are clearly linked in the navigation bar.
        2. The user will be directed to a page with archived blogs available to read.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the individual with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Me" Page.
        2. Here the user can fill out the form on the page, or are told that alternatively they can message the individual on social media.
        3. The footer contains links to the individuals Instagram, Linkedin, Git Hub and Slack pages as well as the individuals email.
        4. Whichever link they click, it will open up in a new tab to ensure that the user can easily get back to the website.
        5. The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to find information about new and/or improved skills.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the navbar link.
        2. For a mobile user already comfortable with the website layout, the section is a short swipe down the page.

    2. As a Frequent user, I want to check for new portfolio entries to view current work.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the portfolio link.

    3. As a Frequent user, I want to check for new blog posts.
        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link.
        2. Upon landing on the blog page, blogs will be displayed in chronological order, beginning with the newest post.
        3. A call to action button has been created in order for users to sign up for newsletters, they will be notified of new blog entries by e-mail.

## Known Bugs

**05/12/21**

-   Social Link Alignment

Alignment of links is slightly out when viewing on Safari mobile (iPhone7) and Firefox mobile (iphone 7), need to investigate.

Fix:

Have added a top padding of 2px to push the links down slightly.

-   Firefox Mobile Night Mode

Night mode on Firefox mobile (iphone 7) is causing the hero image to scroll on top of the navbars instead of behind, will investigate z-index and position of bars. As the navbar colors have now flipped there is also a 1px white border between the navbar and hero image, need to investigate padding.
